# Unit Task 6: Add Question Feature

## Basics
- Name: Problem 6 - Add question feature
- Field / Category: Computer Engineering / PYTHON
- Study Time: 5 hours
- Description: Technical exercise

## Story
After getting the database connected, it feels like real progress. Dr. Han is carefully working through the database when an engineer on Earth sends a short note: there is something called an ORM that can make the work smoother. The blunt message makes Dr. Han smile, and a quick look at ORM suggests it can reduce busywork and bring structure.

## Tasks
- In the `question` folder from Problem 5, create `question_router.py` to handle routing.
- Relevant structure: `main.py`, `database.py`, `models.py`, `domain/question`, `frontend`.
- Build routes with `APIRouter`; set `prefix` to `/api/question`.
- Implement `question_list()` to fetch the list of questions.
- Use ORM to read data from SQLite.
- The endpoint uses the `GET` method.
- Register the router in `main.py` with FastAPI `include_router()`.

## Environment
- Python 3.x.
- Use only built-in Python commands; do not add extra packages.
- Follow Python coding style guide (PEP 8).
- Strings: prefer single quotes `' '`, use double quotes `" "` only when needed inside the string.
- Leave spaces around `=` in assignments (e.g., `foo = (0,)`).
- Indentation uses spaces.

## Constraints
- No packages beyond the standard library; only FastAPI allowed per the assignment.
- Follow PEP 8 for strings, indentation, and spacing.
- Function names in lowercase snake_case with underscores.
- Avoid Python reserved words for function/variable names.
- Class names in CapWords style.
- Code should run without warnings.

## Bonus
- Open `http://<host>/docs` and verify the question list API works.
